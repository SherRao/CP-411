raster graphics (short answer)</h2>
<h3 id="q1.1-frame-buffer">Q1.1 frame buffer</h3>
<p>A frame buffer is a snapshot of a raster pattern that will be
rendered to the display, that is stored somewhere in volatile memory -
this usually being RAM or VRAM. Frame buffer’s are useful if a GPU is
powerful enough to generate more frames than can be rendered by the
machine - instead of wasting the extra computational power, the frame
can be stored in a frame buffer. A frame buffer usually stored one bit
per pixel.</p>
<h3 id="q1.2-pixel">Q1.2 pixel</h3>
<p>A pixel is the smallest part of a display or image that can be
meaningfully be interacted with. Pixels can be indivudually addressed as
a value within a 2-dimensional matrix/array, and can be interacted with
to change their red (r), green (g), blue (b), or alpha (a) values to
display a specific colour.</p>
<h3 id="q1.3-color-depth">Q1.3 color depth</h3>
<p>Color depth is the range of colours that can be displayed by each
pixel. A high colour depth implies that more colours can be rendered per
pixel, leading to more accurate or more saturated frames. Color depth is
measured by how many bits are allocated to a single pixel, the standard
being 24 bits for colour, and 8 bits for the alpha channel.</p>
<h3 id="q1.4-resolution">Q1.4 resolution</h3>
<p>The resolution of an image or display is the amount of pixels that
can be displayed width-wise (number of pixels per scan line) and
height-wise (amount of scan lines), with a higher resolution giving to a
sharper image. Resolution is denoted as “width x height”, the standard
being 1920 x 1080.</p>
<h2 id="q2-concepts-of-raster-display-short-answer">Q2 Concepts of
raster display (short answer)</h2>
<h3 id="q2.1-scan-line">Q2.1 scan line</h3>
<p>A scan line is a single row of pixels in a raster scanning pattern -
this can be a row of pixels on a CRT, or a computer monitor. On a CRT
for example, the individual scan lines can be seen as the image is
rendered one scan-line at a time.</p>
<h3 id="q2.2-refreshment-refresh-rate">Q2.2 refreshment &amp; refresh
rate</h3>
<p>The refresh rate of a display refers to the freqeuncy at which a new
image is displayed - some common framerates being 24, 30, and 60 frames
per second (fps). In older CRT monitors, the electron beam must
constantly be refreshing pixels due to decay. A modern display is also
constantly clearing the screen at a certain refresh rate.</p>
<h3 id="q2.3-frame">Q2.3 frame</h3>
<p>A frame is a fully rendered image/raster pattern on a display, which
is shown for a very small amount of time before a new frame is
rendered.</p>
<h2 id="q3-roles-of-cpu-and-gpu-in-cg-short-answer">Q3 Roles of CPU and
GPU in CG (short answer)</h2>
<h3 id="q3.1-cpu-roles">Q3.1 CPU roles</h3>
<p>The CPU is responsible for sending the data neccessary for the GPU to
calculate and render to the frame buffer. This data, for example, could
be the data describing the vertices of a primitative geometric shape.
The CPU communicated with the GPU over the PCI bus.</p>
<h3 id="q3.2-gpu-roles">Q3.2 GPU roles</h3>
<p>The GPU is responsible for interacting directly with a frame buffer,
which involves geometric, shader, and transformative calculations. Some
example include drawing primitive graphical geometry, or calculating
lighting.</p>
